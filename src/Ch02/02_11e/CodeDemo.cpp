int main(){
    int fahrenheit = 100;
    int celsius;
    int celsius_conversion_wrong;
    
    celsius_conversion_wrong = (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
    /* incorrect way
    If you run this expression above, you will get that celcius = 0 which is wrong (obvi)
    (5 / 9) above is interpreted as a constant expression, and it does not make it to the code that
    will be executed by the processor
    Moreover, since 5 and 9 are both int, (5 / 9) will calculate integer division, and it will only 
    output the quotient of the two which is 0 (discards the remainder i.e. "truncation towards zero").
    So, it would be (5 / 9) = 0, then 0 * (100 - 32) = 0
    */
    celsius = ((float)5 / 9.0) * (fahrenheit - 32);
    /*
    To fix the issue above, we must convert either number to a float or double.
    Note that expressions always conver their values to the largest type present!!
    5 is now explicitly cast to a float and 9 is now 9.0  (double)
