/*
General array notes:
1. Collections of data- accessable through an index
2. Homogeneous- they are all of the same data time 
3. Fixed in size- no resizing
4. Elements are continuous in memory (i.e. the whole array is a sequential block of memory addresses
*/
#include <iostream>
/*about constants:
MACROS have no typing or syntax standards for constants, so be weary of them
const qualifier is a variable declaration, so it does have typing and syntax regulation
      - it means that the variable cannot change
