#include <iostream>
// library that gives you the type information for a variable
// note that it may behave differently depending on your compiler- can throw errors, just need to know
// which IDE denotes which character as what (e.g. "Int64" vs "i")
#include <typeinfo>

    auto a = 8; //int (denoted "i")
