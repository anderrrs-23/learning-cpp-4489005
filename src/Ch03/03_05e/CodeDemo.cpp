// Using Several Source Files, by Eduardo CorpeÃ±o

General notes on Compiling Code:
- A compiler toolchain is a pipeline of software tools that convert source code into an executable file
    [source code] --> [compiler toolchain] --> [executable file]
- inputs can be:
    1. C++ source files --> compiler translates code to an Assembly file (human-readable version of native language of target CPU); --> Assembly file goes to assembler and produces an object file --> Linker
    2. Write Assembly code directly (generally a case when you need to write your own peripehral driver) --> assembler to produce an object file --> Linker
    3. Include libraries for which you only have access to the object files, NOT the source code --> Linker

- C++ source files are 2 components with same name but different extensions:
    - header file (.h) containing definitions and function definitions (sometimes macros) but NOT executable code
    - implementation file (.cpp) contain the implementation of all functions declared in header file (i.e. executable code)
- the compiler must read the header file prior to the implementation file
- your external code (the one that uses classes) should only include header files (not implementation files)
- all implementatino files MUST be compiled: must be inluded in the list of source files in the command line, your make file, or the IDE
